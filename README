FilteredRelation
================

Making dynamic filters easier

Example
=======

posts = Post.filtered_relation(:comments => true).where(:user_id => 4).limit(3).order("id ASC")    

posts.each do |post|  
	# Do something here...  
end  


How can I contribute?
=====================

There is an rails_app directory inside test folder. inside this folder you can generate the test_database:

rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:test:clone

After that, go to the root directory and run the tests:

rake test

Now, you can add your new filtered_relation_condition tested and send a request.
