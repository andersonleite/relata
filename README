FilteredRelation
================

Making dynamic filters easier

Example
=======

1)
posts = Post.filtered_relation(:comments => true).where(:user_id => 4).limit(3).order("id ASC")    

posts.each do |post|  
	# records
end  

2)
Usually you have to create massive querys to deal with complex relations, like:
   select posts.*, COUNT(comments.id) AS comment_count from posts, comments group posts.id having comment_count > 0

Insted just use:
Post.filtered_relation(:published_at => true).related_to(:comments => true).where(:user_id => 4).first
